# python-mtrayapp

## This is a modification of pystray.
This mod provides some extra features, like:

- Message, error, confirm boxes
- OOP-style features for Menu class
- Ability to use file path as icon (Without copying it to other file, like in original lib)
- Maybe something else

For example of modifications, check `tools/test_menu.py`.
